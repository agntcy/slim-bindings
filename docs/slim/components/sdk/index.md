# SLIM SDK

The SLIM SDK provides language-native bindings for building applications that communicate over SLIM. The bindings are generated from the Rust core using [UniFFI](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs), giving every language identical behaviour with idiomatic APIs.

Each binding bundles two components:

- **Data Plane Client** — connects your application to a SLIM routing node, handles name registration, and routes outgoing messages.
- **Session Layer** — provides end-to-end encryption (MLS), reliable delivery, and session management on top of the data plane client.

## Supported Languages

Python, Go, [.NET](./dotnet.md), Java, Kotlin, Node.js, and React Native.

See [Installation](./install.md) for per-language package names, requirements, and install commands. For .NET-specific API details, examples, and platform support, see the [.NET SDK guide](./dotnet.md).

## How It Fits Into SLIM

The following diagram shows where the SDK sits in a SLIM deployment:

    app["Your Application"]

    subgraph sdk["SLIM SDK / Language Bindings"]
        session["Session Layer\n(MLS encryption, reliable delivery, group management)"]
        client["Data Plane Client"]
        session --> client
    end

    node["SLIM Data Plane"]
    network["SLIM Network"]

    app --> session
    client --> node
    node --> network

    style session fill:#4a90e2,stroke:#2e5c8a,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
    style client fill:#f39c12,stroke:#d68910,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
    style node fill:#f39c12,stroke:#d68910,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
```

Applications never connect to each other directly. They connect to a nearby SLIM routing node and let the SLIM network deliver messages to named endpoints. The SDK handles all the plumbing — TLS connections, name registration, session establishment, and message encryption — so your application logic stays clean.

## SDK Tutorials

Work through the tutorials to learn the fundamentals step by step:

1. [Connecting to SLIM](./tutorials/tutorial-connect.md) — Configure and connect your application to a SLIM node
2. [Creating an App](./tutorials/tutorial-app.md) — Register an application identity and set up message handlers
3. [Creating a Session](./tutorials/tutorial-session.md) — Establish point-to-point and group sessions
