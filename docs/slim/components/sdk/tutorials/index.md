# Tutorials

These tutorials walk you through using the SLIM SDK step by step — from establishing a connection to calling remote services with SLIMRPC. Each tutorial builds on the previous one, so work through them in order.

Tutorials include code examples for Python, Go, Java, Kotlin, Node.js, .NET, and React Native where supported.

## Prerequisites

All tutorials assume you have the SLIM SDK installed. See [Installation](../install.md) for setup instructions for your language. For .NET-specific API details and examples, see the [.NET SDK guide](../dotnet.md).
