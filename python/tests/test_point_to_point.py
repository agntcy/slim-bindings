"""
Point-to-point sticky session integration test.

Scenario:
  - One logical sender creates a PointToPoint session and sends 1000 messages
    to a shared logical receiver identity.
  - Ten receiver instances (same Name) concurrently listen for an
    inbound session. Only one should become the bound peer for the
    PointToPoint session (stickiness).
  - All 1000 messages must arrive at exactly one receiver (verifying
    session affinity) and none at the others.
  - Test runs with MLS enabled / disabled (parametrized) to ensure
    stickiness is orthogonal to MLS.

Validated invariants:
  * session_type == PointToPoint for receiver-side context
  * dst == sender.local_name and src == receiver.local_name
  * Exactly one receiver_counts[i] == 1000 and total sum == 1000
